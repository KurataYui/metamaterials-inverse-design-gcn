# metamaterials-inverse-design-gcn
This repository contains the code and data developed for my Bachelor's Thesis on the inverse design of lattice metamaterials using Graph Convolutional Autoencoders (GCAE). It includes data generation, preprocessing, model training, geometric reconstruction, and JSON-based lattice generation workflows.
